HEASoftPy [Beta]: A Python interface to HEASoft

Before installing HEASoftPy, you should have already installed a Python interpreter (version 2 or 3) and HEASoft itself.  To install Python, use a package installer from your operating system, or other third-party Python packages.  To install HEASoft, please visit the download page at:

 https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/download.html

In order to use HEASoftPy, it will need to be available in a directory path included in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.  This can be done automatically when initializing HEASoft using the following instructions:

(For an alternative approach see the footnote at the bottom of this file *)

First make sure that your HEASoft installation includes a "python" directory underneath the installed "lib" directory, for example:

  heasoft-6.28/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.30/lib/python

If your copy of HEASoft is already initialized, this equates to $HEADAS/lib/python.  This directory may already exist (if you installed e.g. PyXspec with HEASoft), but if not, create it and 'cd' into it:

  > cd heasoft-6.28/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.30/lib   [cd $HEADAS/lib]
  > mkdir python
  > cd python

Unpack the HEASoftPy tar file (heasoftpy.tar) here, for example:

  > tar xf ~/Downloads/heasoftpy.tar

You should now have this folder:

  heasoft-6.28/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.30/lib/python/heasoftpy
  [i.e. $HEADAS/lib/python/heasoftpy]

Continuing to use this example directory path, initialize (or re-initialize) HEASoft in the standard way, i.e.

  For Bourne shell variants:
  > export HEADAS="/path/to/heasoft-6.28/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.30"
  > source $HEADAS/headas-init.sh

or

  For C-shell variants:
  > setenv HEADAS "/path/to/heasoft-6.28/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-libc2.30"
  > source $HEADAS/headas-init.csh

At this point, you can check that PYTHONPATH includes $HEADAS/lib/python:

  > echo $PYTHONPATH

If it does, you can start up Python and import heasoftpy:

  > python
  >>> import heasoftpy

The first time HEASoftPy is imported, files will be written into the heasoftpy/defs directory which contain functions correpsonding to tasks in the HEASoft suite.  Those functions should be callable using the following method:

  >>> heasoftpy.TASK(ARGUMENTS)

For example, if you want to run ftlist on test.fit:

  >>> heasoftpy.ftlist(infile='test.fit')

If you import the software using "as" an alias, such as

  >>> import heasoftpy as hsp

then you can run ftlist with:

  >>> hsp.ftlist(infile='test.fit')

If you use the "from" form of import:

  >>> from heasoftpy import ftlist

you can run ftlist using:

  >>> ftlist(infile='test.fit')


* Note that if you prefer to set up HEASoftPy independently of your HEASoft installation, just unpack the HEASoftPy tar file in a location of your choosing and make sure that location is in your PYTHONPATH environment variable (and that HEASoft has been initialized) before running Python.
