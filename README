This repository currently contains two test versions of Python interfaces to HEAsoft.

One version generates the interfacing functions "on the fly"; in other words, at the time the function is called. This version exists in the directory named "onthefly" and is imported via:

import heasoft.onthefly

The other version generates the functions once - the first time the module is imported. This is imported via:

import heasoft.writ_fns

Tests are under development.
