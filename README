This directory contains the heasoftpy code.

After you have installed the software, add the heasoftpy directory to your PYTHONPATH and import with:

import heasoftpy

The first time this is imported, files will be written into the heasoftpy/defs directory which contain functions correpsonding the tasks/program in the heasoft software suite. Those functions should be callable via something like:

    heasoftpy.TASK(ARGUMENTS)

For example, if you want to run ftlist on test.fit:

    heasoftpy.ftlist(infile='test.fit')

If you import the software using "as" and an alias, such as:

    import heasoftpy as hsp

then you can run ftlist with:

    hsp.ftlist(infile='test.fit')

If you use the from form of import:

    from heasoftpy import ftlist

you can run ftlist using:
    ftlist(infile='test.fit')
