This repository holds the (development) version of the heasoftpy tools.

After you have cloned the repository, add the heasoftpy directory to your PYTHONPATH and import with:

import heasoftpy

The first time this is imported, files will be written into the heasoftpy directory which contain functions correpsonding the tasks/program in the heasoft software suite. The should be callable via something like:

heasoftpy.TASK(ARGUMENTS)

For example, if you want to run ftlist on test.fit:

heasoftpy.ftlist(infile='test.fit')

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently this directory contains two other versions of the Python interfaces to HEAsoft. These are (for the time being) being kept for archival/reference purpose. One version generates the interfacing functions "on the fly"; in other words, at the time the function is called. This version exists in the directory named "onthefly" and is imported via:

import heasoft.onthefly

The other version generates the functions once - the first time the module is imported. This is imported via:

import heasoft.write_fns

A few tests are available in tests/test_tasks.py.
