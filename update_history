Modification history for heasoftpy
Version 0.1 ME:    Initial version
Version 0.1.1 MFC: corrects identification of prompting for required, missing
                   parameters
Version 0.1.2 ME:  Added Error classes and handling errors when the underlying
                   program encounters an error.
Version 0.1.3 ME:  Added checks of function versions and replacement of
                   functions that are outdated.
Version 0.1.4 ME:  Pre-populate the results.params field in a generated function
                   so that all values used by the corresponding FTool are in the
                   params field (which later has user-specified values replace
                   the defaults where appropriate).
Version 0.1.5 ME:  Added help, including putting fhelp contents into the
                   docstrings of the created functions.
Version 0.1.6 ME:  Split creation of functions so that those that can accept
                   a single (positional) argument can do so with that required
                   argument (often the input file) as the default.
Version 0.1.7 ME:  Re-read parameter file after subprocess call to underlying program
                   and load into result.params. Moved _read_par_file function to utils
                   and renamed it read_par_file.
Version 0.1.8 ME:  Cleaned up code, removed debugging messages and restructured
                   directories in preparation for release
Version 0.1.9 ME:  Modified how a parameter can be considered required, so that "q"
                   (query) mode is considered.
Version 0.1.10 ME: Preparations for beta release
Version 0.1.11 ME: Extract the system pfiles directory from the PFILES environment variable
                   (instead of concatenating syspfiles to contents of $HEADAS env variable -
                   needed for users who will use both CIAO and heasoftpy).
Version 0.1.12 ME: Added informational message about the creation of files. (GitLab issue #9)
Version 0.1.13 ME: Modified the informational message. (GitLab issue #9)
Version 0.1.14 ME: Replaced LOGGER.INFO with LOGGER.info (GitLab issue #16)
                   Fixed the re-reading of par files after running the FTool. (GitLab issue #3)
Version 0.1.15 ME: Extracted the actual creation of the function files for the HTools/FTools
                   programs into an install script, removing that functionality from this file.
Version 0.1.16 ME: Moved the setattr inside the check for the corresponding file and added
                   message if the file doesn't exist.
Version 0.1.17 ME: Added error checks to utils.read_version. Extracted the update history from
                   __init__.py and put it in update_history (this file).
Version 0.1.18 ME: Added __str__ method to result.Result class. Added local_pfiles() function
                   to __init__.py. Code cleanup in clean_heasoftpy.py. Updated exception
		   handling in install.py when encountering errors with Unicode decoding.
Version 0.1.19 ME: Added is_param_ok function to utils and updated install.py to have each
                   task function call that function for each of its parameters.
Version 0.1.20 ME: Modified utils/__init__.py.ask_for_param() to add the default to the query
                   and accept it with just an <Enter> response.
Version 0.1.21 ME: Reverted to using the system parameter file to generate functions to fix
                   bug (using the local par file led to functions that did not accept single
		   positional parameter when they should have). Also added code to better
		   handle the PFILES environment variable when other tools (e.g. CIAO) have
		   changed/set its value after it reported that this was leading to crashes.
Version 0.1.22 ME: Some bug fixes were made.
		   Python dictionaries containing parameter names and values
		   can now be passed into wrapper functions instead of passing
		   the parameters as keywords and values (which still works if
		   that is preferred).
		   The help message for the heasoftpy module was modified to
		   make it more informative.
Version 0.1.23 ME: Added get_heasoft_version. Made several bug fixes, including:
                   removal of logging from the import, and correcting issues
		   involving the creation of wrappers for FTools that accept
		   single, positional arguments.
Version 0.1.24 ME: Set HEADASNOQUERY environment variable to True in an effort
                   to eliminate problems using heasoftpy in jupyter notebooks.
