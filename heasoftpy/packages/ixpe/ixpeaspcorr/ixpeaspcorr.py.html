<h2>NAME</h2>
ixpeaspcorr -- Corrects for residual aspect errors using interpolated event position averages over time intervals of user-specified number of seconds.
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>ixpeaspcorr.py infile n [statout] [uncorr]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 
ixpeaspcorr uses event time stamps and sky X,Y values from an IXPE Level 1 event FITS file (infile) to compute average position over a time width of (n) seconds. A corrected position is then given for each event by subtracting the difference between the interplolated means of the n events and the mean of all events from the uncorrected position. If x_pix_mean and/or y_pix_mean are set to values other than “-“, these values will be used instead of the mean of all events.
<p>If statout=True, then the running mean and standard deviation for each axis position is added as columns X_AVG, X_STD, and Y_AVG, Y_STD. If uncorr=True, the original, uncorrected position columns are retained as X_UNCORR, Y_UNCORR and, if statout=True also, then the uncorrected statistics columns X_AVG_UNCORR, X_STD_UNCORR, Y_AVG_UNCORR, and Y_STD_UNCORR are also added. The input file is overwritten with these new columns added as well as a new keyword, XPASPCOR, to prevent unintentional multiple running of ixpeaspcorr.
<p>In addition, ixpeaspcorr will optionally calculate the interpolated position of the spacecraft ponting direction on the sky plan and add these values as a new column (TXYDZ_CORR) to an attitude file if att_path=True.
